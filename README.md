# Sidebar-launcher
A rainmeter sidebar launcher
This project is only a very simple design, I plan to improve and add more features in the future
In the meantime feel free to download.
To add more icons:
1. Find the icon for the app you want to add.
2. Resize the icon in a tool like paint.net or photoshop to 64x64 ppx
3. Delete the background from the icon
4. Add the icon to the @Resources\icons folder
5. Edit the sidebar and copy an entry inside (eg. copy the part that says "firefox" etc)
6. Rename the title to the app you want
7. Change the icon and add the filepath
8. Enjoy!
9. The spacing underneath is 70ppx, but you can change it if you want
